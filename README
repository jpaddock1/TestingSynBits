A group of ansible scripts produced on an account in DXC.technology for OneView in order to configure the Proof of Concept Synergy server

In this GitHub, it holds the structure of files in order for the Ansible playbooks to work.

NOTE ON PLAYBOOKS: 
All the plabooks are in the path of: roles > quicktest > tasks. Here are 3 folders: Create, Delete and Gather. Within these folders hold the playbooks. In order to use these playbooks, they will need to be in the 'tasks' folder and renamed to 'main.yml' otherwise Ansible will not read the file.

NOTE ON VARIABLES: 
When using a variable file, ensure the variables file is also called 'main.yml' as, once again, Ansible will not read it. 
Also it will need to be placed in the 'vars' folder. The account variable file is not on here, but an example one is. If needing the used file, please contact someone in the Synergy POC team

NOTE ON CONFIG FILE:
The file details are not on the site for security reasons. If required, please contact the Nucleus Synergy POC team. When recieved, the file should go in the 'top' folder (same location as the site.yml and ansible.cfg files)

TIP:
If wanting to produce Ansible with multiple functions (example delete multiple ethernet functions), copy the required code and paste directly under and change the relevant details. Ansible will read the playbook and complete the tasks
